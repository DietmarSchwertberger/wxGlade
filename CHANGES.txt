2002-07-22: TODO.txt: updated
	    docs/tech_notes.txt: added (incomplete)

2002-07-20: edit_sizers.py: - added a create_properties method, with the same 
			      purpose of EditBase.create_properties
			    - fixed a couple of bugs (double Destroy call) on
			      SizerSlot
	    widgets/splitter_window.py: completed transition from the old
					Property behaviour to the new one
	    xml_parse.py: created ClipboardXmlWidgetBuilder, to parse the 
			  contents of the clipboard
	    clipboard.py: changes to use the new ClipboardXmlWidgetBuilder

2002-07-19: main.py, widget_properties.py, edit_windows.py, edit_sizers.py:
                     fixed a lot of memory leaks

2002-07-18: widget_properties.py: changed all the Properties: they are not
                                  instances of wxPanel anymore, but they have
                                  a panel attribute, which is initialized only
                                  when needed (i.e. when the owner of the 
                                  Property has focus)
            edit_windows.py, edit_sizers.py: changes to reflect the new 
                                             behaviour of Properties: now
                                             the notebook inside which 
                                             Properties are displayed is
                                             built only when needed
            xml_parse.py: nothing special, but thanks to the new behaviour
                          of Properties, loading from an xml is MUCH faster!

2002-07-17: codegen/py_codegen.py: - support for multiple output files
                                   - initial support for tags in the generated
                                     source files to know what to 
                                     overwrite and what to leave untouched

2002-07-16: codegen/py_codegen.py: - initial support for multiple files
				   - if __name__ == '__main__' block on 
				     generated code
				   - remove duplicate declarations of custom
				     classes when there is more than one 
				     instance

                                   - translated the last Italian comment to

                                 - fixed bug in xml_builder which prevented 
                                 the 'class' property from having the right 
                                 value
            widgets/splitter_window.py: - fixed bug in the generated code when

                                        - fixed bug in xml_builder which

            widgets/static_line.py: - fixed bug in xml_builder which
