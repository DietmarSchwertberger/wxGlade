wxGlade: a GUI builder for wxPython/wxWindows
version: 0.2
license: MIT (see license.txt)

THIS PROGRAM COMES WITH NO WARRANTY

* Requirements:
---------------
Python >= 2.2
wxPython >= 2.3.2.1 


* Installation:
---------------
If you are reding this file, you already did all the necessary :-)
To start the program, enter ``python wxglade.py'' in your shell


* Documentation:
----------------
In the docs/ subdir there's a short introductory tutorial.  In the samples/
subdir there are some sample wxGlade apps (in xml format, .wxg file extension).

NOTE FOR OLD USERS: even if you already know wxGlade, you should probably read
the last section of the tutorial, since it contains information that all users
should know.


* Known Bugs/Issues:
--------------------
- I don't know if it works on the Mac (OS X): if you try it on such platform,
  please let me know if it works.

- On Windows, selection tags may not be shown properly in some cases.

- On Windows, the program exits always "abnormally", i.e. it prints something
  like:
  16:54:51: Debug: c:\projects\wx\src\msw\app.cpp(439): 'UnregisterClass(canvas)' failed with error 0x00000584 (class has open windows).
  Anyway, this doesn't seem to affect the program behaviour.

- On GTK, if your last operation before exiting is a paste from the clipboard,
  wxGlade exits with a segfault.

- On GTK, menubars give troubles: they produce a lot of Gtk-WARNING and 
  Gtk-FATAL messages and may cause segfaults.

- On GTK, notebooks can cause some Gtk-WARNING messages, but they seem to work 
  anyway.


For any kind of question, there's a mailing list at
