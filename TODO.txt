wxGlade TODO list
-----------------
Last update: 2002-10-12

The list is more or less sorted by priority

Things Done:
------------

- Code generation on separate files

- "tags" on the generated code, to detect the portions of code to replace and
  those to keep as is, when updating an existing file

- better support of custom classes, that is to say:
  - Avoid double class declaration on the generated files when using
    multiple instances of the same custom class

- Investigation of the many memory leaks 

- speedup of the xml loading 

- separation between window objects and sizer ones in the generated code 

- Code generation from the command line, witout starting the GUI

- support wxWindows xml resources (XRC) through a code generator

- support for C++ code generation


Real TODO (# = Partially done):
-------------------------------

- Undo/Redo

- Possibility to chane the type of a sizer after its creation (#: almost done,
  but needs *A LOT* of testing)
 
- Possibility to change the position of a widget inside its sizer (#: almost
  done, needs testing)

- Event handlers support

- Edit -> Preferences... to customize some aspects of wxGlade

- International characters support (#)

- Checks on the values of some properties (name, class,...), maybe with
  wxValidator 

- ListCtrl and TreeCtrl

- More basic properties for widgets (enabled for example)

- ToolBar for frames 

- complete MenuBar with icons and StatusBar messages support (#)

- Grid

- Less frequently used controls

- on-line help (with wxHtmlHelpController)

- test of the various modules with unittest (this might come earlier...)

- gettext support

- ``Templates'' for particular windows (for example, something as a dialog with
  an image, a centered label and a couple of buttons)

- TabOrder property (this may be hard though)

- better support of custom classes:
  - Avoid xml code duplication: this may be hard

- ...
