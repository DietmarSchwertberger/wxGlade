- separation between window objects and sizer ones in the generated code 

- Code generation from the command line, witout starting the GUI

- support for C++ code generation

- Possibility to chane the type of a sizer after its creation
 
- Possibility to change the position of a widget inside its sizer

- Edit -> Preferences... to customize some aspects of wxGlade

- International characters support

- complete MenuBar with icons and StatusBar messages support (#)

- Less frequently used controls

- on-line help (with wxHtmlHelpController)

- test of the various modules with unittest (this might come earlier...)

- gettext support (#: done for code generation, todo for wxGlade itself)

- ``Templates'' for particular windows (for example, something as a dialog with
  an image, a centered label and a couple of buttons)

- TabOrder property (this may be hard though)

- ...
