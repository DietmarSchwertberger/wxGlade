wxGlade TODO list
-----------------
Last update: 2002-07-22

The list is more or less sorted by priority

Key: 
     (*) Done, needs testing  
     (#) Working on it...
     All the others are open issues


- Code generation on separate files (*)

- "tags" on the generated code, to detect the portions of code to replace and
  those to keep as is, when updating an existing file (*)

- better support of custom classes, that is to say:
  - Avoid double class declaration on the generated files when using
    multiple instances of the same custom class (*)
  - Avoid xml code duplication (in the same case as above): this may be hard

- Unicode support (#)

- Investigation of the many memory leaks (#)

- speedup of the xml loading (#)

- custom wxDirDialog (to choose the destination dir for the generated
  code, as the Windows default one doesn't allow to create a new dir)

- Checks on the values of some properties (name, class,...), maybe with
  wxValidator 

- MDI

- Code generation from the command line, witout starting the GUI

- Event handlers support

- Edit -> Preferences... to customize some aspects of wxGlade

- ListCtrl and TreeCtrl

- More basic properties for widgets (enabled for example)

- ToolBar for frames 

- complete MenuBar with icons and StatusBar messages support

- support wxWindows xml resources (XRC) through a code generator

- Grid

- Less frequently used controls

- on-line help (with wxHtmlHelpController)

- test of the various modules with unittest (this might come earlier...)

- gettext support

- support for C++ code generation (and maybe other languages, if someone wants
  to do the work)

- ``Templates'' for particular windows (for example, something as a dialog with
  an image, a centered label and a couple of buttons)

- ...
