wxglade (0.3.5.cvs20050824-0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Sponsored upload.
  * renamed the package to python-wxglade. the python-wxgtk packages
    don't have a version schema as well, so it doesn't make sense with
    wxglade as well.
  * Depend on python-wxgtk2.6 | python-wxgtk. These are the new names,
    and you have at least to depend on a real package.
  * Build-depend on python (needed for dh_python).
  * Repackage as a .orig.tar.gz package.
