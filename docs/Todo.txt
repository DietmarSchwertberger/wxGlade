User Interface:
 * implement "re-do / Ctrl-Y" to apply last property modification to currently selected widget
 * multiple selections in Tree window -> allow editing properties for multiple widgets at the same time
 * new dialog for Toolbar (similar to the new menu dialog)
 * support events from the base classes and the addition of any event as text
 * change the user interface towards ribbons, property grid and a single frame instead of separate windows?
done:
 * ask user whether he really wants a standalone menu/toolbar


Code generation:
 * refactor code generation (direct generation instead of XML parser)
 * improve readability of the generated code 
 * add a preview tab for the generated code / better integrate automatic and user generated code
 * option to switch off code generation random facts like: "# generated by wxGlade 0.6.8"
 * Code property: split into global, local/private and post-init
 * Code (property): read user code from file
 * support ID-less menus also in C++ (i.e. without explicitely defining an ID)

File Format:
 * get rid of obsolete options -> convert when opening file
 * add file format revision?
