1. Setup PyInstaller
--------------------

Install the current version of PyInstaller from http://www.pyinstaller.org.
Follow the instruction published at PyInstallers homepage.

This procedure is tested using PyInstaller versions 2.1

2. Generate an executable
-------------------------

- Open a command prompt and change into source base directory

- To delete temporary Python bytecode files type:
  del /S *.pyo
  del /S *.pyc

- To generate the version file "RELEASE-VERSION" type:
  python.exe -c "import config; config.write_version_file(config.get_version(False))"

- Check if pyinstaller well configured
  Type:
  pyinstaller --version

  The result should be 2.n

- Generate binary for standalone edition
  Type:
  install\pyinstaller\build.bat

  If everything works, you should now have two new subdirectories
  "build" and "dist".

- Now you should have a working executable in "dist/bdist", called
  "wxglade.exe".

  If it works, you can move on to the next step

3. Generate an installer
------------------------

- Download and install Inno Setup from here:
  http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php

- To create the installer for the Standalone Edition open
  "wxglade-SAE-installer.iss" with Inno Setup and run it.

- To create the regular installer open "wxglade-installer.iss" with Inno
  Setup and run it.

- If everything works, you should have the installer executables in the
  "dist" directory. "wxGlade-SAE-<version>-setup.exe" is the installer of the
  Standalone Edition. And "wxGlade-<version>-setup.exe" is the regular
  installer.

- All done!
