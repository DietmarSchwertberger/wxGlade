  <title>Introduction to wxGlade</title>

  <section>
    <title>What wxGlade is</title>
    <para>
        wxGlade is a GUI designer written in Python with the popular
        GUI toolkit wxPython, that helps you create wxWindows/wxPython
        user interfaces. At the moment it can generate Python, C++ and
        XRC (wxWindows' XML resources) code.
</para>
<para>        As you can guess by the name, its model is Glade, the famous
        GTK+/GNOME GUI builder, with which wxGlade shares the philosophy
        and the look &amp; feel (but not a line of code).
    </para>
  </section>
  
  <section>
    <title>What wxGlade is NOT</title>
    <para>
        It is not (and will never be) a full featured IDE, but simply
        a <quote>designer</quote>. The generated code does nothing apart from displaying
        the created widgets. If you are looking for a complete IDE,
        maybe Boa Constructor <ulink url="http://boa-constructor.sourceforge.net">http://boa-constructor.sourceforge.net</ulink>
        or PythonCard <ulink url="http://www.pythoncard.org">http://www.pythoncard.org</ulink> is the right tool.
    </para>
  </section>
  
  <section>
    <title>Download</title>
    <para>
        You can download source files for the stable version from the
        sourceforge project page 
        <ulink url="http://sourceforge.net/projects/wxglade">http://sourceforge.net/projects/wxglade</ulink>.
      </para>  
<para>        You can get the unstable version from Sourceforge anonymous CVS
        access. Refer to Sourceforge CVS documentation for details.
</para>

<para>        Also binaries for Microsoft Windows and Linux are provided for
        download.
</para> 
  </section>
  
  <section>
    <title>Installation and requirements</title>
    <para>
        While Python is a pseudo-interpreted language, you don't need
        any <quote>compile</quote> or <quote>make</quote> steps.
</para>

<para>        wxGlade requires Python version 2.2 or later and wxPython version
        2.3.2.1 or later.</para>
<para>        The binary versions are stand-alone and don't have any requirement.
    </para>
    <para>You can download wxWindows from 
    <ulink url="http://www.wxwindows.org">http://www.wxwindows.org</ulink> and wxPython from 
    <ulink url="http://www.wxpython.org">http://www.wxpython.org</ulink>.</para>
    <para>In the Microsoft Windows system you only need to install wxPython 
    while wxWindow is not required.</para>
    <para>In a Linux/Unix environment you need to install wxPythonGTK that usually require 
    also the wxGTK package. Mandrake Linux 9.2 comes with a libwxPython rpm that works, without
    installing wxGTK.</para>
    <para>If you use apt or yum, just install wxPythonGTK package, and let it resolve
    the dipendeces.</para>
  </section>
  
  <section>
    <title>Basics</title>
    
<para>You need to know the basics of wxWindows or wxPython, as well as the basics of C++, Python or Perl.
You can't use wxGlade if you do not have any basic understanding of programming.
You can't learn wx programming from reading this manual either.

<chapter>  
  <title>Exploring wxGlade</title>  
  <section>
    <title>Quick start</title>
    
<para>        We will design a simple form.
</para>
<para>        Start wxGlade by running the <command>wxglade.py</command> program.
</para>
<para>        You will see a Main Palette, with several buttons, and a Tree
        Window with an icon marked <quote>Application</quote>.  A Properties Window shows the properties 
of the Application.
</para>

<para>        If you move the mouse over a button in the main window, a tooltip will display its function.
</para>

<para>        To add a frame in the design window, from the Main Palette choose
        the first button: <quote>Add a frame</quote>.
</para>
<para>        Then choose wxFrame as base class.
</para>
<para>        Look at the tree window and see that two icons are generated
        under the application icon, a frame icon and a sizer icon.
</para>
<para>        If you double click with the mouse on the frame icon, the designer
        window appears.
        Notice that the sizer is displayed as a set of gray boxes: they are
        the <quote>slots</quote> of the grid sizer where you will place the widgets.
</para>
<para>        You put a widget on a sizer by selecting it on the Main Window,
        then click on an empty slot on the frame on the designer window.
        Try adding a static text, a text control and a button.
</para>
<para>        If you want to add something else, add empty slots on the sizer by
        right-clicking on the sizer on the tree window and selecting 
        <quote>Add slot</quote>.
</para>        
<para>        Play around, adding four or five widgets on the frame.
</para>
<para>        Now look at the properties form; there are three tabs. In the 
<quote>Common</quote>
        tab you can specify the name, size and color of the widget.
</para>        
<para>        In the <quote>Layout</quote> tab you can adjust borders and alignments.
</para>        
<para>        In the <quote>Widget</quote> tab you find the properties depending on the
        widget.
</para>
<para>        You can select the properties of a widget by clicking on the designer window
        or the corresponding icon on the tree window.
</para>        
<para>        Try adjusting widgets with the properties form until you know you have
        played enough.
</para>
<para>        Now let's generate the code.
</para>
<para>        Select the Application icon on the tree window and
        go to the properties window.
</para>        
<para>        Check Name and Class, choose a Top window, check Single file and
        choose the language
        and set the Output path by pushing the button for selecting a path and a filename.
</para>        
<para>        Finally press the Generate code button, and the code is generated.
</para>
<para>        Compile and enjoy.
</para>    
  </section>
  
    <section>
      <title>Basics of wxGlade</title>
        
      <para>The program wxGlade is a tool for designing Graphical User Interfaces (GUI).
</para>        
      <para>        It is intended to be used with the wxWindows framework in all its flawors: C++, Perl, 
        Python and XRC.
</para>        
        <para>You use a visual editor for creating forms, menus and toolbars with the mouse.
        </para>
        <para>Your design is saved in a .wxg file, which is the wxGlade file format.
        </para>
        <para>Then you generate source code or XRC by using visual tools or invoking wxGlade at the 
command line.
        </para>
        <para>You can also use wxGlade in your makefile by generating source code only when the .wxg
        changes.
        </para>
        <para>A .wxg file can contain multiple forms, panels, menus and toolbars and generate either 
        a single file containing all classes or multiple files containing one class each.
        </para>
        <para>The wxGlade does not manage events, file inclusion, function names, stubs, 
        and noting else the graphic interface code.</para>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>Command line invocation</title>
      <para>You can run wxGlade without parameters to start the GUI on a empty application as follows:
      </para>
      <para><command>wxglade.py</command> 
      </para>
      <para>Run wxGlade GUI on an existing application specifying the .wxg file as follow: 
      </para>
      <para><command>wxglade.py FILENAME.wxg</command>
      </para>
      <para>If you only want to generate the code without starting the GUI, use the -g or 
--generate-code option with the language as argument as follows:
      </para>
      <para><command>wxglade.py -g LANG FILENAME.wxg</command> 
      </para>
      <para><command>wxglade.py --generate-cod=LANG FILENAME.wxg</command>
      </para>
      <para>Possible values for LANG are "python", "XRC", "perl" or "C++". 
      </para>
      <para>You can also specify the destination of the generated code 
with -o or --output option:
      </para>
      <para><command>wxglade.py -g LANG -o DESTINATION FILENAME.wxg</command>
      </para>
      <para>The DESTINATION argument can be a file or a directory. 
It is a file when the FILENAME.wxg generates single-file source code. 
It is a directory when the FILENAME.wxg generates multiple-file source code. 
      </para>
      <para>This is the complete description of the command line:
      </para>
      <para><literallayout><computeroutput>wxglade.py [OPTIONS] [FILENAME.wxg]
OPTIONS:

-g LANG, --generate-code=LANG
	Generate the code in the LANG language. Possible values for LANG are C++, python, perl, XRC.

-o DEST, --output=DEST
	Only valid with the -g option. Specify the destination for the code generation.
	The argument DEST can be a source code file or a directory.</computeroutput></literallayout>
</para>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>Using the source code</title>
<para>How do you use source code generated by wxGlade? Basically in two ways.
</para>
        <para>You can safely edit the source code of the generated class. This is because
        wxGlade marks the untouchable code with the special 
        comments <quote>begin wxGlade</quote> and <quote>end wxGlade</quote>.
        </para>
        <para>So you can edit all you need outside these two tags. When you make 
        changes in your forms, a new code generation will not modify the user code.
</para>
        <para>The other way is to generate the class with wxGlade in a file (e.g. myFormUI.xxx) and 
        subclass it in another file (e.g. myForm.xxx). This gives you the psychological advantage
        that there is a file for you and one for wxGlade :-) . 
        That way if you are stuck writing messy code you can erase your entire source 
        file.</para>
        <para>There is an annoying problem in wxWindows: you can put widgets directly on a wxFrame 
        or in a wxPanel that belong to the wxFrame. If you choose the first option, in Microsoft
        Windows the frame looks quite odd.</para>
        <para>While wxGlade doesn't generate the wxPanel within the wxFrame, a good way
        of working is to design a wxPanel with wxGlade (choose "dialog" in the main toolbar) 
        and import it into the wxFrame. This give
        you the double advantage to separate code and UI and to preserve the 
        wxFrame-wxPanel-Widgets structure.
        </para>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title id="basic.bitmaps.section">Specifying the path of bitmaps</title>
    <para>In wxGlade some widgets need to specify a bitmap path.
    You can use any graphic format supported by wxWindows.</para>
    <para>The bitmap can be specified in some ways:</para>
    <para>Usually you can type an absolute path in a textbox or browse
    for a bitmap with a file dialog. This will produce a wxBitmap object
    with the typed string as bitmap path (e.g. <emphasis>wxBitmap("/usr/share/icons/application.png", 
    wxBITMAP_TYPE_ANY)</emphasis>)</para>
    <para>You can enter a variable name using the <emphasis>var:</emphasis> tag in the textbox. 
    This will produce a wxBitmap object with the variable name as bitmap path 
    (e.g. <emphasis>var:my_bitmap_path</emphasis> produce <emphasis>wxBitmap(my_bitmap_path, 
    wxBITMAP_TYPE_ANY)</emphasis>). 
    In perl code generation a <quote>$</quote> sign is added if you omit it.</para>
    <para>You can enter a code chunk returning a wxBitmap, by using the <emphasis>code:</emphasis> 
    tag. This produce literally the code you enter in brackets and nothing more 
    (e.g.: if wxSomeWidget need a wxBitmap as argument, the string 
    <emphasis>code:if (x == 0) get_bitmap1() else get_bitmap2();</emphasis> produce 
    <emphasis>wxSomeWidget((if (x == 0) get_bitmap1() else get_bitmap2();), option1, 
    option2)</emphasis>).</para>
    <para>Never wxGlade declare nor assign variable or funcion names, so after code 
    generation, you have to provide extra code to declare you variables or function.</para>
    <para>If you use <emphasis>var</emphasis>: or <emphasis>code:</emphasis> tags the
    preview window show a empty bitmap with fixed size.</para>

    <title>Main Palette</title>
    <para>
      The main window is a palette that hosts the menu and 
      the widget choice buttons.
    </para>
    <para> 
      <figure>
        <title>The Main Palette</title>
        <graphic fileref="main_window.png" />
      </figure>
    </para>
    <para>
        If you pass the mouse pointer over a button a tooltip shows the button's 
        description.
    </para>
    <para>
        The <quote>Add a Frame</quote> button and the <quote>Add a Dialog/Panel</quote> button 
        bring up a dialog
        to add a frame, a dialog or a panel to your project.
    </para>
    <para>
    The <quote>Add a MenuBar</quote> button asks to you for the name of the class
    then adds a menu bar to your project.
    </para>
    <para>
    The <quote>Add a ToolBar</quote> button asks you for the name of the class
    then adds a toolbar to your project.
    </para>
    <para>
        Other buttons in the main window add widgets in a form. 
        When you click on such button, 
        the cursor pointer change to an arrow. Then you can click on
        a sizer's empty cell and add the widget to it.
    </para>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>Tree Window</title>
    <para>
      The tree window shows the logical hierarchy of widgets 
      and its child-widgets. For example you can see a panel as a tree's 
      node and the widgets on it as a child nodes.
      <figure>
        <title>The Tree Window</title>
        <graphic fileref="tree_window.png" />
      </figure>
    </para>
    <para>
    You can show or hide the tree window by the menu item View/Show Tree
    or with the Ctrl-T shortcut.
    </para>
    <para>
      Usually a frame or a panel contains a sizer, so you
      often see a sort of panel-sizer-widgets structure.
      The tree gets more complex when you nest sizers within sizers. 
    </para>
    <para>
    You have a visual presentation of your widget tree that 
    you can navigate by mouse, expand and collapse sizers,
    copy, cut or remove widgets.
    </para>
    <para>
    A click on an icon in the tree window displays the properties of the corresponding element
    in the properties window.
    A double click in a frame, dialog or panel icon, makes the designer window show it as it appears.
    Clicking with the right button of the mouse gives you a pop-up menu.
      <figure id="label_menu.fig">
        <title id="label_menu.title">The menu for a widget</title>
        <graphic fileref="label_menu.png" />

        <title id="sizer_menu.title">The menu for a sizer</title>
        <graphic fileref="sizer_menu.png" />
      </figure>
      The pop-up menu for a widget allows you to copy, cut or remove the element. 
      The pop-up menu for a sizer allows you to copy, cut or remove the element, 
      or add or insert an empty slot. 
      <emphasis>Note</emphasis>: Often when you add an empty slot, you have to make the designer window
      larger, to show the new slot.
    </para>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>Design Window</title>
    <para>
      The design window shows the frame or panel you are creating in WYSIWYG mode and  
      allow you to select a widget from the main palette and to put it on an empty slot of a sizer.
      You can show the design window by double-clicking on the icon of a frame or dialog in 
the tree window.
      <figure>
        <title>The Design Window</title>
        <graphic fileref="design_window_empty_slot.png" />
      </figure>
    </para>
    <para>
    By clicking with the right mouse button on a widget you
    can access to the context menu. Notice that the sizers, 
    which are invisible elements,  have a 
    little gray <quote>handle,</quote> that you can click to select the sizer 
    or let the pop-up menu appear.
    </para>
    <para>The pop-up menu is the same as the one you get in the Tree Window,
    as shown in <xref linkend="label_menu.fig" />
    or in <xref linkend="sizer_menu.fig" />.
    </para>
    </section>
  <section>
    <title>Properties Window</title>
    <para>
      The properties window lets you see and edit the 
      properties that 
      apply to the selected element. This window
      consists of three tabs. The first tab contains the 
      common properties that apply to all widgets.
      <figure id="properties_window_tab_1.fig">
        <title>Common Properties</title>
        <graphic fileref="properties_window_tab_1.png" />
      </figure>
    </para>
    <para>
    As shown in <xref linkend="properties_window_tab_1.fig"/>
    the common properties are related to name, size, 
    colors and fonts. 
    </para>
    <para>
    The second tab is related to layout properties that control position
    and resizing within the sizer.
      <figure id="properties_window_tab_2.fig">
        <title>Layout Properties</title>
        <graphic fileref="properties_window_tab_2.png" />
      </figure>
    These properties apply to any widget.
    You can check or uncheck any option related to the placement
    in the sizer. Many widgets may have a default value of 3 in the "Border" 
    property in the Preferences Dialog (see <xref linkend="preferences.section"/>).
    If you let a widget have a default border, the <option>wxALL</option> option
    is also checked.
    </para>
    <para>
    The third tab, named <quote>Widget,</quote> is different for each widget, and lets
    you edit properties for the specific element you have selected.
      <figure id="properties_window_tab_3.fig">

    The set of options may also be quite complex in the case of a widgets that have 
    a great deal of methods and properties (such as grids and treeviews). In this case, wxGlade 
    greatly simplifies the process of designing forms.

    You can show or hide the properties window by the menu item 
    <menuchoice>
        <shortcut><keysym>Ctrl-P</keysym></shortcut>
        <guimenu>View</guimenu>
        <guimenuitem>Show Properties</guimenuitem>

        <section>
            <title>Editing properties</title>
            <para>
            Editing properties is quite simple; Properties are represented
            by buttons, text boxes and checks.
            Usually they are referenced by the same name or symbol
            that you find writing C++ code.
            </para>
            <para>
            Usually you get the changes in the design window in real time. 
            In some cases you have to push the "Apply" button.
            For example, the wxNotebook widget
            shows in its properties window a list of child wxPanels.
            You have to press the apply button to show changes you make
            when you add or remove panels.

    <menuchoice>
        <guimenu>View</guimenu>
        <guimenuitem>Preferences</guimenuitem>
    </menuchoice>.
    You can choose some decoration options, like whether to show icons in menus or not,
    but also something more effective.
    For example, you can modify the number of buttons in the Main Palette.
    If you type a value of 15 or 30, you get a long toolbar-like
    Main Palette. 
    You can also choose the default path where you save wxGlade files 
    or generate source code.
    </para>
    <para>
    Another useful option is to enable a default border of 3 
    around some widgets. In many cases this can be useful to have set.
