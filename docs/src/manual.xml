  <title>Introduction to wxGlade</title>

  <section>
    <title>What wxGlade is</title>
    <para>
        wxGlade is a GUI designer written in Python with the popular
        GUI toolkit wxPython, that helps you create wxWindows/wxPython
        user interfaces. At the moment it can generate Python, C++ and
        XRC (wxWindows' XML resources) code.
</para>
<para>        As you can guess by the name, its model is Glade, the famous
        GTK+/GNOME GUI builder, with which wxGlade shares the philosophy
        and the look &amp; feel (but not a line of code).
    </para>
  </section>
  
  <section>
    <title>What wxGlade is NOT</title>
    <para>
        It is not (and will never be) a full featured IDE, but simply
        a <quote>designer</quote>: the generated code does nothing apart from displaying
        the created widgets. If you are looking for a complete IDE,
        maybe Boa Constructor <ulink url="http://boa-constructor.sourceforge.net">http://boa-constructor.sourceforge.net</ulink>
        or PythonCard <ulink url="http://www.pythoncard.org">http://www.pythoncard.org</ulink> is the right tool.
    </para>
  </section>
  
  <section>
    <title>Download</title>
    <para>
        You can download source files for the stable version from the
        sourceforge project page

      </para>  
<para>        You can get the unstable version from Sourceforge anonymous CVS
        access. Refer to Sourceforge CVS documentation for details.
</para>

<para>        Also binaries for Microsoft Windows and Linux are provided for
        download.
</para> 
  </section>
  
  <section>
    <title>Installation and requirements</title>
    <para>
        While Python is a pseudo-interpreted language, you don't need
        any <quote>compile</quote> or <quote>make</quote> steps.
</para>

<para>        wxGlade requires Python version 2.2 or later and wxPython version
        2.3.2.1 or later.</para>
<para>        The binary versions are stand-alone and doesn't have any requirement.
    </para>
    <para>You can download wxWindows from 
    <ulink url="http://www.wxwindows.org">http://www.wxwindows.org</ulink> and wxPython from

<chapter>  
  <title>Exploring wxGlade</title>  
  <section>
    <title>Quick start</title>
    
<para>        We will design a simple form.
</para>
<para>        Start wxGlade running <command>wxglade.py</command> program.
</para>
<para>        You will see a Main Window, with several buttons, and a Tree
        Window with a icon <quote>Application</quote>.  A Properties Window is showing
        properties of the Application.
</para>

<para>        If you move the mouse over a main window's button, a tooltip
        display the function of the button.
</para>

<para>        To add a frame at the design window, from the Main Window choose
        the first button: <quote>Add a frame</quote>.
</para>
<para>        Then choose wxFrame as base class.
</para>
<para>        Look at the tree window and see that two icons are generated
        under the application icon, a frame icon and a sizer icon.
</para>
<para>        If you double click with the mouse on the frame icon, the designer
        window appears.
        Notice that the sizer is displayed as a set of gray boxes: they are
        the <quote>slots</quote> of the grid sizer where you will place the widgets.
</para>
<para>        You put a widgets on a sizer by selecting it on the Main Window,
        then click on a empty slot on the frame on the designer window.
        Try adding a static text, a text control and a button.
</para>
<para>        If you want add something else, add empty slots on the sizer by
        right-click on the sizer on the tree window and selecting 
        <quote>Add slot</quote>.
</para>        
<para>        Play adding four or five widgets on the frame.
</para>
<para>        Now look at the properties form; there are three tabs. In the 
<quote>Common</quote>
        tab you can specify name, size and color of the widget.
</para>        
<para>        In the <quote>Layout</quote> tab you can adjust borders and alignements.
</para>        
<para>        In the <quote>Widget</quote> tab you find the properties depending to the
        widget.
</para>
<para>        You can select the properties of a widget by clicking on the designer window
        or the corresponding icon on the tree window.
</para>        
<para>        Try adjusting widgets with the properties form until you know you
        played enougth.
</para>
<para>        Now let's generate the code.
</para>
<para>        Select the Application icon on the tree window and
        pay attention to the properties window;
</para>        
<para>        Check Name and Class, choose a Top window, check Single file and
        choose the language
        and set the Output path pushing the button for selecting a path and a filename.
</para>        
<para>        Finally press the Generate code button and the code is generate.
</para>
<para>        Compile and enjoy.
</para>

      <title>Basics of wxGlade</title>
        
      <para>The program wxGlade is a tool for designing Graphical User Interface (GUI).
</para>        
      <para>        It is intended to use with wxWindows framework in all its flawors: C++, Perl, 
        Python and XRC.
</para>        
        <para>You use a visual editor for creating forms, menus and toolbars with the mouse.
        </para>
        <para>Your design is saved in a .wxg file that is the wxGlade file format.
        </para>
        <para>Then you generate source code or XRC by using visual tools or invoking wxGlade 
        in the command line.
        </para>
        <para>You can also use wxGlade in your makefile generating source code only when the .wxg
        change.
        </para>
        <para>A .wxg file can contains multiple forms, panels, menus and toolbars and generate 
        a single file containing all classes or multiple files containing one class each.
  </para>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>Command line invocation</title>
      <para>You can run wxGlade without parameters to start the GUI on a empty application as follow:
      </para>
      <para><command>wxglade.py</command> 
      </para>
      <para>Run wxGlade GUI on an existing application specifying the .wxg file as follow: 
      </para>
      <para><command>wxglade.py FILENAME.wxg</command>
      </para>
      <para>If you want only to generate the code without starting the GUI, use the -g or --generate-code option with the language as argument as follow:
      </para>
      <para><command>wxglade.py -g LANG FILENAME.wxg</command> 
      </para>
      <para><command>wxglade.py --generate-cod=LANG FILENAME.wxg</command>
      </para>
      <para>Possible values for LANG are "python", "XRC", "perl" or "C++". 
      </para>
      <para>You also can specify the destination of the generated code 
with -o or --output option:
      </para>
      <para><command>wxglade.py -g LANG -o DESTINATION FILENAME.wxg</command>
      </para>
      <para>The DESTINATION argument can be a file or a directory. 
It is a file while the FILENAME.wxg generate a single file source code. 
It is a directory while the FILENAME.wxg generate multiple file source code. 
      </para>
      <para>This is the complete description of command line:
      </para>
      <para><literallayout><computeroutput>wxglade.py [OPTIONS] [FILENAME.wxg]
OPTIONS:

-g LANG, --generate-code=LANG
	Generate the code in the LANG language. Possible values for LANG are C++, python, perl, XRC.

-o DEST, --output=DEST
	Only valid with the -g option. Specify the destination of the generation of code.
	The argument DEST can be a source code file or a directory.</computeroutput></literallayout>
</para>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>Using the source code</title>
<para>        How do you use source code generated by wxGlade? Basically in two ways.
</para>
        <para>You can safely edit the source code of the generated class. This because
        wxGlade mark the untouchable code with the special 
        comments <quote>begin wxGlade</quote> and <quote>end wxGlade</quote>.
        </para>
        <para>So you can edit all you need outside these two tags. When you makes 
        changes in your forms, a new code generation will not modify the user code.
</para>
        <para>The other way is to generate the class with wxGlade in a file (e.g. myFormUI.xxx) and 
        subclass it in another file (e.g. myForm.xxx). This give you the psychological advantage
        that there is a file for you and one for wxGlade :-) . 
        If you stuck writing a messy code you can erase your entire source file.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Main Window</title>
    <para>
      The main window hosts the menu and the widgets choice buttons.
    </para>
    <para> 
      <figure>
        <title>The Main Window</title>
        <graphic fileref="main_window.png" />
      </figure>
    </para>
    <para>
        If you pass the mouse pointer over a button a tooltip show the button's 
        description.
    </para>
    <para>
        The <quote>Add a Frame</quote> button and the <quote>Add a Dialog/Panel</quote> button 
        show up a dialog
        to add a frame, a dialog or a panel to your project.
    </para>
    <para>
    The <quote>Add a MenuBar</quote> button ask to you for the name of the class
    then add to your project a menu bar.
    </para>
    <para>
    The <quote>Add a ToolBar</quote> button ask to you for the name of the class
    then add to your project a toolbar.
    </para>
    <para>
        Other buttons in the main window adds widgets in a form. 
        When you click on such button, 
        the cursor pointer change in an arrow, then you can click on
        a sizer's empty cell and add the widget to it.
    </para>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>Tree Window</title>
    <para>
      The tree window show the logical ierarchy of widgets 
      and its child-widgets. For example you can see a panel as a tree's 
      node and the widgets on it as a child nodes.
      <figure>
        <title>The Tree Window</title>
        <graphic fileref="tree_window.png" />
      </figure>
    </para>
    <para>
      Usually a frame or a panel contains a sizer, so you
      often see a sort of panel-sizer-widgets structure.
      The tree get more complex while you nest sizers on sizers. 
    </para>
    <para>
    You have a visual presentation of your widget tree that 
    you can navigate by mouse, expand and collapse sizers,
    copy, cut or remove widgwts.
    </para>
    <para>
    A click on the tree window, on an icon you display properties of the corresponding element
    in the properties window.
    A double click in a frame, dialog on panel icon, make the designer window to show the 
    corresponding 
    Clicking with the right button of the mouse you get a pop up menu.
      <figure>

      The pop up menu for a widget allow you to copy, cut or remove the element. 
      The pop up menu for a sizer allow you to copy, cut or remove the element 
      and add or insert an empty slot as well. 
    </para>

    <title>Design Window</title>
    <para>
      The design window show the frame or panel you are creating in WYSIWYG mode and  
      allow you to select a widget from the main window and to put it on a empty slot of a sizer.
