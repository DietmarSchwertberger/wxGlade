\chapter{Introduction to WxGlade}
                            WxGlade is a GUI designer written in Python with the popular
                             GUI toolkit wxPython, that helps you create wxWindows/wxPython
                             user interfaces. At the moment it can generate Python, C++ and
                             XRC (wxWindows' XML resources) code. 
                            
                            As you can guess by the name, its model is Glade, the famous
                             GTK+/GNOME GUI builder, with which wxGlade shares the philosophy
                             and the look \&\{\} feel (but not a line of code).
                            
                            
                            
                            It is not (and will never be) a full featured IDE, but simply
                             a "designer": the generated code does nothing apart from displaying
                             the created widgets. If you are looking for a complete IDE,
                             maybe Boa Constructor (http://boa-constructor.sourceforge.net/)
                             or PythonCard (http://www.pythoncard.org/) is the right tool.
                            
                            
                            
\section{Download}
                                You can download source files for the stable version from the
                                 sourceforge project page (http://sourceforge.net/projects/wxglade).
                                
                                
                                You can get the unstable version from Sourceforge anonymous CVS
                                 access. Refer to Sourceforge CVS documentation for details.
                                
                                
                                Also binaries for Microsoft Windows and Linux are provided for
                                 download.
                                
\section{Installation and requirements}
                                    
                                    
                                    While Python is a pseudo-interpreted language, you don't need
                                     any "compile" or "make" steps.
                                    
                                    
                                    wxGlade requires Python version 2.2 or later and wxPython version
                                      2.3.2.1 or later.
                                    The binary versions are stand-alone and doesn't have any requirement.
\section{Basics}
                                        
                                        
                                        You need to know basics of WxWindows or WxPython. 
                                        
                                        
                                        
                                        
                                        Also you need basics of C++ or Python.
                                        
                                        
                                        
                                        
                                        You can't use wxGlade if you have not any basic of programming.
                                        
                                        
                                        
                                        
                                        You can't learn Wx programming reading this manual, as well.

\section{Design a simple form}
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    We will design a form as in the picture.
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    \includegraphics{manualdes.eps}

                                                    
                                                    
                                                    Notice that there are two text labels, two edit box and two button.
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    They are posed in a sort of grid of three rows and two columns.
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    For designing that, start wxGlade running wxglade.py program.
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    You will see a Main Window, with several buttons, and a Tree
                                                     Window with a icon "Application".  A Properties Window is showing
                                                     properties of the Application.
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    \includegraphics{.eps}

                                                    
                                                    
                                                    If you move the mouse over a main window's button, a tooltip
                                                     display the function of the button.
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    To add a frame at the design window, from the Main Window choose
                                                     the first button: "Add a frame". 
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    Then choose wxFrame as base class.
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    Look at the tree window and see that two icons are generated
                                                     under the application icon, a frame icon and a sizer icon.
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    If you double click with the mouse on the frame icon, the designer
                                                     window appears. 
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    Rigth-click on sizer icon on the tree window and click "Remove"
                                                     to remove the sizer.
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    Then click on the "Add a GridSizer" button on the main window,
                                                     then click on the empty space on the frame on the designer window.
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    Type "3" in the "Rows" text box, and 2 in the "Cols" text box,
                                                     check the "Flexible" button, and click on "OK".
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    The designer window show now six grey areas: they are the "cells"
                                                     of the grid sizer where you will place the widgets.
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    Now click on the "Add a static text" button on the main window
                                                     and then click on the first empty gray "cell" of the sizer.
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    A label of text will be placed on the grid.
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    Now, in the same way, place another static text, two text box
                                                     with the "Add a text control" button and two buttons with the
                                                     "Add a button" button.
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    Now you have all widgets on the design window, and you have to
                                                     adjust size and alignement.
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    Look at the properties form; there are three tabs. In the "Common"
                                                     tab you can specify name, size and color of the  
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    widget. In the "Layout" tab you can adjust borders and alignements.
                                                     In the "Widget" tab you find the properties depending to the
                                                     widget.
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    Select the first static text you placed on the design window,
                                                     either clicking on the design or in the tree window.
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    In the tab "Widget" of the properties window you find the text
                                                     box "Label"; type "First name: " in.
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    Type "Last name: " in the second static text as well.
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    In the same way change the label of the two buttons in "OK" and
                                                     "Cancel". 
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    Select the first static text again and click on the "Layout"
                                                     tab of the properties window.
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    Type "5" in the "Border" text box and check wxALL and wxALIGN\_\{\}CENTER\_\{\}VERTICAL
                                                     check buttons.
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    Make the same steps for the other static text and
