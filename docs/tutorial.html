<h1>wxGlade Tutorial</h1>
    
<p>The aim of this minimal tutorial is to give an overview of wxGlade and
its functionalities: despite its very short length, it is (hopefully) complete
enough to make you understand how the application works, through a step-by-step
description of the creation of a frame containing a notebook with some controls,
a menubar and a statusbar.<br>
 </p>
    
<p>Before we start, let me apologize for my English: it's not my native language
(I'm Italian), so it is very far from perfection.<br>
 </p>
    
<h3>1. Creation of the frame</h3>
    
<p>To create a new frame, click on the appropriate button of the "palette"
(<img src="img/frame_button.gif" align="middle" width="31" height="31"
 border="0">): a dialog asking for the name of the class of the new window
is displayed: choose the name you prefer, but remember that it must be a
valid name for a Python (or C++) class.<br>
 </p>
    
<p>Now the empty frame is displayed, and the properties window changes to
show the attributes of the widget just created. The first thing we'll do is
change the title of the frame, which is by default equal to the object's name,
and insert "Frame with notebook": the change takes effect when the Title
property loses focus.<br>
 </p>
    
<h3>2. Creation of the menubar</h3>
    
<p>Let's activate the "Widget" tab of the properties notebook of our frame,
and check the property "Has MenuBar" to create a menu bar for the frame.</p>
    
<p>The properties window changes again, and now it shows the properties of
the menubar: let's click on the "Edit menus" button to add some menus with
the Menu Editor.<br>
 </p>
    
<p>Click on the button "Add" to add a menu, and then edit the "label" field
to change its value to "File".<br>
 Let's then add some menu items to our File menu: click on the "Add" button
again, change "label" to "New", and finally click the "&gt;" button: after
the latter action we can see that the label of our item ("New") is indented
compared to the previous one ("File"): this says that "New" is an item of
"File".<br>
 Repeat the previous operations "ad libitum" to add other menus and items
(and sub-menus), then click "OK": the window gets closed, and our menubar
contains the menus we added.<br>
 </p>
    
<h3>3. Creation of the statusbar</h3>
    
<p>Under the "Has MenuBar" property of our frame there's the "Has StatusBar"
one: check it to add the statusbar.<br>
 </p>
    
<p>The "Fields" property of the object just added keeps the fields to display
on the statubar: double-click on a field to edit it; to add, remove, insert
other fields use the appropriate buttons.<br>
 Edit the default field, an set its value to "Created with wxGlade!", then
add some other fields with the "Add" button: the "Size" column shows the dimension
of each field: you can change them as you like, but remember that one of
the fields must have a size of &nbsp;-1 (which tells that it will fill the
remaining space).<br>
 After performing these operations, click on the "Apply" button to reflect
the changes on the widget.<br>
 </p>
    
<h3>4. Creation of the notebook</h3>
    
<p>Now it's time to add a notebook to our frame: before doing it it's necessary
to set a Sizer for the frame. This is a very important operation in wxGlade,
as every container widget must have a Sizer before you can add sub-widgets
to it.<br>
 </p>
    
<p>Let's set the Sizer of the frame, then: to do so, click on the BoxSizer
button (<img src="img/box_sizer_button.gif" align="middle" width="31"
 height="31" border="0">) on the palette: now when you move the mouse inside
the frame's client area, the pointer changes its shape and becomes a cross
(this may not be true if you are using MS Windows): this tells us that we
can drop the Sizer on the frame.<br>
 A left-click starts the operation, and a dialog asking for some features
of the Sizer to add appears: as we have to add only an element to the Sizer
(our notebook), the default values of the various attributes are OK.<br>
 </p>
    
<p>Now we can add the notebook, clicking on the corresponding button (<img
 src="img/notebook_button.gif" align="middle" border="0" width="30"
 height="30">) and dropping it inside the sizer just added: a dialog window
appears again, which asks to choose the tab placement (choose what you like
best).<br>
 </p>
    
<p>Now let's select the "Common" tab of the properties of the object just
added: we can see that the "Class" property's value is "wxNotebook", i.e.
the name of the class our object is an instance of. If we change such value,
we can make our notebook an instance of a custom class derived from wxNotebook:
this has no effect during the creation of the app, but it changes the generated
code, so that a definition for our custom class will be written. Let's change
then the value of "Class" to "MyNotebook", to make wxGlade generate the code
for the custom class.</p>
    
<h3>5. Adding and removing notebook pages</h3>
    
<p>This operation is almost identical to the handling of statusbar fields:
the "Tabs" property of our notebook controls the number of pages (tabs) and
their labels.<br>
 </p>
    
<h3>6. Addition of some controls</h3>
    
<p>We have now reached the last part of this short tutorial: the addition
of some controls to the first page of our notebook. In particular, we'll add
a text area and two buttons: these operations will allow us to show the layout
options of the objects inside sizers, and the (currently limited) cut &amp;
paste support of wxGlade. <br>
 </p>
    
<p>Let's start with the addition of a sizer to the first page of the notebook:
again, let's click on the BoxSizer button (<img
 src="img/box_sizer_button.gif" align="middle" width="31" height="31"
 border="0">), and then inside the page, to make the sizer features dialog
appear: this time we have to change the default values, and set to Vertical
the orientation and to 2 the number of slots. None of the two actions are
mandatory, since both the orientation (or better, the type) of the sizer
and the number of slots can be changed in any moment: the former by changing
the value of the "Class" property, the latter from the popup menu you can
activate with a right-click on the "handle" button of the sizer or on the
corresponding node of the tree of widgets. (As a side note, this same procedure
can be used to show the menu of almost every object handled by wxGlade).<br>
 </p>
    
<p><font size="4"><b>6.1 Text area</b></font></p>
    
<p>Let's click on the TextCtrl button (<img
 src="img/text_ctrl_button.gif" align="middle" width="30" height="30">) and
insert the text area in the first slot of our sizer. </p>
    
<p>The default dimension isn't right, as we want to display a long and multiline
text: to edit the layout, let's select the "Layout" tab of the TextCtrl's
properties, and set to 1 the value of "Option" and to wxEXPAND that of "Alignment".
 To make the text area multiline, let's check the wxTE_MULTILINE checkbox
of the "Style" property (in the "Widget" tab): as with almost every Style
property in wxGlade, such change has no visible effect, but it changes the
generated code.</p>
    
<p><b><font size="+1">6.2 Buttons</font></b><big><br>
 </big></p>
   
<p><big></big>Now replace the second slot with a horizontal Sizer which will
contain our two buttons: set the number of slots to 3, to leave room for a
spacer to insert between the two buttons (so as they won't appear too close).<br>
 </p>
 
<p>Replace then the first slot with a new button, as usually with the approprate
button (<img src="img/button_button.gif" align="middle" width="30"
 height="30">).<br>
 To add the second button, instead, we will use the clipboard: let's click
on the "Copy" item of the popup menu of the first button, then move the mouse
inside the third slot, and finally click on the "Paste" item of the popup
menu of the slot to paste the copied widget.<br>
 </p>
    Now add a spacer (<img src="img/spacer_button.gif" align="middle"
 width="30" height="30">) of the appropriate dimension between the buttons,
to keep them at a reasonable distance.<br>
     
<p>Finally, the last operation we have to do is to edit the layout of the
horizontal Sizer that contains the buttons: set to 0 the value of "Option",
uncheck wxEXPAND from "Aligment" and check wxALIGN_CENTER_HORIZONTAL, and
set a border (4) on the top (wxTOP) and bottom (wxBOTTOM), to keep the buttons
separate from the text area and the notebook lower border. <br>
 </p>
 
<p><b>NOTE on widgets' ids: </b>You certainly know that every wxWindows widget
has an id, used among other things for event handling, so in wxGlade each
widget has an "id" property. This may have the following values:<br>
 </p>
 
<ul>
   <li><u>a number</u>: this will be the integer which will be passed to the
constructor of the widget</li>
   <li><u>a name</u>: in this case wxGlade assumes it is the name of an id
declared somewhere in the program, and uses it. For example, you can set
the value of "id" to "wxID_OK" for the default OK button of a dialog</li>
   <li><u>a pair name=value</u>: in this case before the constructor of the
widget the declaration of the variable is generated. For example you could
write TEST_BUTTON=wxNewId() to generate the id of a button called "Test"
   (note for C++ code generation: since ids are stored in an anonymous enum,
only constant initializers are allowed, so the assigment above is not legal
- but you can use, for instance, TEST_BUTTON=100)<br>
     <br>
   </li>
 
</ul>
 
<p> </p>
    
<h3>7. Last changes</h3>
Finally, suppose you are not happy with the current layout, and you decide
it's better to put the buttons above the text area and not below as they
are: so what can we do? Simple: let's change the value of the "Pos" property
of the sizer which contains the buttons, and set its value to 0, to move
the sizer before the text area: easy, isn't it? <br>
<br>
  Now our window is complete: all we have to do is set a reasonable initial
size for it. To do this, resize the frame until you find a good size, and
then activate the "Size" property.<br>
    
<h3>8. Code generation</h3>
  Before we proceed with the code generation, let's save our work, selecting
the "Save As..." item of the "File" menu of the main wxGlade window: this
operation is not strictly necessary, but it's a good practice to not risk
to loose the work, in particular until wxGlade will reach a certain maturity
:-)<br>
   
<p>Now we can go on with the code generation: select the "Application" item
on the tree of widgets (it is the root) to make the "Application" tab appear
on the properties window. This panel contains the options for the code generation:<br>
 </p>
    
<ul>
  <li><u>Name</u>: name to give to the wxApp object which represents the application:
if this property and the next one (Class) are not active, there will be no
code for the application startup, but only that of the various  widgets<br>
 </li>
   <li><u>Class</u>: name of the class derived from wxApp which represents
the application: if this property is not active but the previous one (Name)
is, the application object will be an instance of wxPySimpleApp (this applies
to Python output only - for C++ output this property must be active if you
want the startup code to be generated)</li>
   <li><u>Top window</u>: main window of the application to generate<br>
 </li>
   <li><u>Code generation</u>: this controls the kind of output, and lets
you choose between a single source file containing all the widgets, or a separate
file for each custom class defined (for C++ output, the single-file mode
actually generates two files, a ".h" and a ".cpp")<br>
  </li>
 <li><u>Language</u>: this lets you choose the language of the generated code:
at the moment, Python, C++ and XRC, i.e. wxWindows resources xml format. Note
that in this last case some of the properties of the application are ignored
(Name, Class, Top window), and some are disallowed (you cannot set Code generation
to multi-files)<br>
  </li>
    <li><u>Output path</u>: in single-file mode, name of the output file;
in   multi-file mode, path to the output directory<br>
  </li>
   <li><u>Generate code</u>: button which starts the code generation</li>
 
</ul>
    
<p>After the selection of the various options as described above, click on
the "Generate code" button: if everything is OK, after a while a message box
appears: this says that the operation is over... like this short tutorial
;-)<br>
 </p>
  
<h3>9. Notes</h3>
    
<p>All the operations described here have been tested and should not give
problems. If this is not true, there could be many causes, among which:<br>
 </p>
  
<ul>
  <li>You used strange characters: at the moment wxGlade has only a support
for ASCII and latin-1 strings, and no support for other encodings: this is
due mainly to my total ignorance of character encodings :-(<br>
   </li>
   <li>Your version of wxPython may not be compatible with wxGlade (or better,
wxGlade might not be compatible with a particular wxPython version): it requires
at least 2.3.2.1<br>
   </li>
    <li>When you add a sizer, there are problems on the layout of the properties
window: this happens sometimes on Windows, but I've not found the problem
yet.<br>
 </li>
  <li>wxGlade doesn't work on any environment except for my laptop and my
old 486 (where it is unusable because of the slow speed): even if I think
this is not probable, it is an option I have to consider :-)</li>
 
</ul>
