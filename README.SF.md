wxGlade: A GUI builder for wxPython/wxWidgets
=============================================

**This version of wxGlade has a minor bug!**

wxGlade need a private directory 
*C:\\Users\\<your user name>\\AppData\\Roaming\\wxglade* to store runtime 
information as well as log files. Unfortunatally it doesn't create this
directory itself. Please create the wxglade directory manually and restart 
wxGlade after that.
